# DeleteEverything
Delete all your files with a simple command.

This contains a python3 file with the python `os` package.

# Warning ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€
This file <i>WILL DELETE</i> <b>ALL FILE</b> including files from `/home` folder

## Instructions
After running, the file will ask you to press Enter to continue and will run the following command: os.system("rm -rf /") This command will remove everything in the root (/) directory and will also ask before you run the file with the root password. Obviously, this file deletes the file on Linux systems, if you try to use it on Windows for example it won't work.


## Advice
To run the file faster you can create an alias to run like a command, for example - `alias DeleteEverything="python3 [Path of the file]/delete_everything.py"`
You can write the alias on `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.
